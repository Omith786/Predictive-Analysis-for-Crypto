# Predictive-Analysis-for-Crypto

This project is a cryptocurrency price prediction system designed to explore how machine learning can provide insights into highly volatile markets. The goal was to leverage historical price data, trading volumes, and market indicators to forecast short-term trends and help inform data-driven decisions.

The system uses time-series analysis and machine learning models to capture patterns in cryptocurrency price movements. By training on extensive historical datasets from platforms like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, the models attempt to identify trends, momentum, and potential reversals. While predicting crypto prices with complete accuracy is impossible due to market unpredictability, this project demonstrates how statistical learning and feature engineering can uncover actionable insights.

What makes this project unique is the focus on interpretability and experimentation. Users can compare different models, test various feature sets, and visualise predicted versus actual performance over time. The project also highlights the challenges of noisy, non-stationary data in financial markets, encouraging thoughtful analysis rather than blind reliance on predictions.
